Welcome to django-ca's documentation!
=====================================

**django-ca** is a small project to manage TLS certificate authorities and easily issue and revoke
certificates. It is based on `pyOpenSSL <https://pyopenssl.readthedocs.org/>`_ and `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_.  It can be used as an app in an existing Django project or
stand-alone with the basic project included.  Certificates can be managed through Djangos admin
interface or via `manage.py` commands - so no webserver is needed, if youâ€™re happy with the
command-line.

Features:

* Create certificate authorities, issue and revoke certificates in minutes.
* Receive e-mail notifications of certificates about to expire.
* Certificate validation via the included OCSP responder and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
* Complete, consistent and powerful command line interface.
* Optional web interface for certificate handling (e.g. issuing, revoking, ...).
* Written in pure Python2.7/Python3.4+, using Django 1.8 or later.
